# DETECTRS_OMETIFF

DETECT_Read_Save_OMETIFF was designed to ease the use of ImageJ/Fiji for manual separation of single plane from multiple-ZTC image files (i.e. TIFF).

The acquisition of multi-stack and multi-colour time series images is easy but the pre-rocessing of it is not.

For example, the animal moving makes the motion correctiion a necessity step.

And we need to separate time series images in individual Z.

Users often manually do these tasks in ImageJ, Icy or other softwares : 1. read files, 2. re-order hyper-stack, 3. split colours, etc.

Although they are wonderful apps with friendly GUI, mouse-moving and clicking are time-consuming.

## What can DETECTRS_OMETIFF do?
DETECTRS_OMETIFF can read X,Y,Z,T,C value from OME.TIFF and separate single-/multi- Z/T/C images into individual Z file(s).

But if the order is not in standard OME ZTC order, I don't promise that.
